Add a photo of a debit or credit card on GitHub.
Just head to the [project](https://github.com/edapm/decards-project), and add your image:

1. What brand/bank issued your card? If there is a folder for the brand or bank already, e.g. Starling Bank, add your image into the appropriate folder. 
   - Otherwise, create a folder by copying the template folder (*template/*) and filling in the information. 
2. Then, add your image in and rename it as follows:
    ```
      [account type]-[card type].jpg
    ```
    e.g. **Monzo** *Current Account Debit Card* would be `ca-d.jpg` (current account, debit card)
    or **Monzo** *Flex Credit Card* would be `f-c.jpg`
3. Finally, push the changes to a pull request to be checked by the moderators.

If you have submitted your PR incorrectly, a moderator will reach out.
